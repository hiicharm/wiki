## The Purpose
I don't know what places on the internet you are browsing to have landed here!  

Anyways, welcome!! This is my personal wiki.  
I try to keep  track of the things I learn on my journey to being a better engineer.
This is just the place for that. Here you can find structured docs and maybe some resources on what is xyz. How to do abc?  
More than anything else, it is my personal guide to doing things and avoid repeated google and AI searches.

If you find encounter issues in here or maybe some suggestions or just need some help figuring out stuff, you can drop me an email at [say@hiicharm.in](mailto:say@hiicharm.in)
