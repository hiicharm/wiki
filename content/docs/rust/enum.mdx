# Enums

A value is one of possible set of values. Defining an enum creates a type with that identifier in type namespace?

```Rust
enum Shape{
    Rectangle,
    Circle,
}
```

Anything that is of the type Shape can either be a Rectangle or a Circle

```Rust
let box= Shape::Rectangle;
```

## Storing Data in Enums

```Rust
enum BagItem{
    Fruit(String),
    Vegetable(String),
}

let x=Item:2
```

## Option Enum / Null Values

Null as the idea represent absence of value.
Option is rust's implementation of the concept of null. A lot of functions/operations return the option enum.

```Rust
enum Option <T>{
    None,
    Some(T),
}
```

Meaning that the value could be nothing (Option::None or simply None) or something(Option::Some(val) or some(val)).
Both Option and and its variants are included in the prelude.

```Rust
let x=Option::Some(5);
let x=Some(5);

let y= Option::None;
let y=None;
```

The use? To use a value of an enum type, you need to pattern match e.g. using match here:

```Rust
println!("{x}"); //this is not allowed //you can't use the values of Option type as if they are definitely present
match x{
    None=> println!("nah"),
    Some(val)=> println!("hehe"),
}
```

Since the values can't be used directly, you're forced to handle all the cases explicitly.
