description: Intro to Rust
---
This is a collection of resources I'm following and encountering while learning rust.  
Primary source is [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)   
Supplementary (with some basics missing, but some topics explained quite well) [Brown University Version](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/)   
For now, I'm just uploading my handwritten notes directly (colorful notes, brain go happi happi). I might add other resources and optimise stuff later.
