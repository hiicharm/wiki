# Generic Data Types

Generics can be used in fn signatures, structs, enums among other things to create definitions with placeholder types, that can later be replaced with concrete types.
Using generics doesn't affect runtime performance. Each instance of a generic item is replaced with concrete types at compile time.

## Generic Functions

Before using a generic param in fn definiton, we need to declare it. Notice the angle brackets after fn name(before using in params).

```Rust
fn largest <T>(list:&[T]->&T){}
```

## Generic Struct

Struct fields can also make use of generic data types, to do so the type param must be declared before use.

```Rust
struct Point<T,U>{
    x:T,
    y:U,
}
```


## Generic Enum

```Rust
enum Result<T,E>{
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

## Generic Impl Blocks

```Rust
impl Point<T> Point<T>{} //works for all types

impl Point<f32>{} //works only if T is f32
```
