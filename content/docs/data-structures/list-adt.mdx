## Abstract Data Type(ADT)
Abstract data types are mathematical ideas of the properties and behaviour for a data structure.
## Lists
The list adt can be vaguely defined as a linear collection of data that has some properties and operations like insertion, removal, reading and modifying data elements.  
Now you can achieve these operations in different ways, by making different space/time tradeoffs.  

## Different Implementations
If you take a look at any of the dsa courses, you'll be overwhelmed by the number of data structures. Most courses have this order:
 - Arrays
 - Stack
 - Queues
 - Linked List  
 and so on

If you do not come from a computer science background, you'll think of them as completely different topics. But they are not!  
Think of them as different implementations of the same thing, the list adt, just with a few tweaks(different tradeoffs, we talked about earlier).  
Like a superhero whose job is to finish some villain. Now it's on you to imagine how the hero does it, does he use a sword? or laser? or just his hands? No matter what, it will do the same job.
